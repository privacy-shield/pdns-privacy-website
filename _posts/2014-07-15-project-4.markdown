      <h3 class="section-heading">Pursuing ISP Authorization for Controlled IP Spoofing</h3>
      <p class="lead">
         Our team aims to gain recognition for its efforts in 
contributing to a safer cyberspace by encouraging broader participation from pDNS data providers. However, to 
reduce maintenance costs and streamline long-term operations, it is desirable to secure support from a trusted 
local entity to serve as an intermediary for hosting the Passive DNS Privacy Shield. This would enable local 
pDNS data providers to route their data through this entity instead of relying on a foreign VPS. To realize this 
approach, cooperation from local ISPs would be necessary—specifically, to grant special permissions for allowing 
packets with spoofed IP addresses from a designated address pool to be transmitted to these trusted intermediaries. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-heading">Enhancing Sensor Compatibility and Deployment Efficiency</h3>
      <p class="lead">
       Our team acknowledges the complexity involved in developing pDNS data sensors compatible with a wide range of platforms and hardware 
used by different organizations. To support the majority of enterprise and commercial-grade routers, future work will focus on identifying commonly used models, understanding their requirements and limitations, and providing precompiled versions of the pDNS data sensor. This would eliminate the need for organizations to perform compilation or cross-compilation themselves. Instead, they would simply select the appropriate version from a list of supported sensors, deploy it to their system, and execute it. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-heading">Maintenance Framework for Long-Term Sustainability </h3>
      <p class="lead">
      For the proposed initiative to be scalable and viable for long-term adoption, particularly by larger and/or international organizations, it is essential to establish a robust maintenance and support framework for all project components. This includes the continual maintenance and expansion of the pDNS data sensor repository, as well as the regular updates and patch management for the Passive DNS Privacy Shield. Without such a system in place, the effectiveness and reliability of the solution would diminish over time as new technologies and platforms emerge.</p>
      <h4 class="section-heading"> Regular update of pDNS data respository </h4>
      <p class="lead">
      As new operating systems and router firmware versions, and embedded platforms are released, new versions of sensors will need to be developed, compiled, and made available. There must be a process in 
place to track these updates and ensure the range of supported environments for the sensors are supported. In parallel, the Passive DNS Privacy Shield needs to undergo regular updates as well. These updates may include new forms of encryption and performance improvements. To manage this effectively, a formal versioning system should be implemented, along with thorough changelog documentation and testing protocols to ensure stability and backward compatibility.  
      </p>
      <h4>Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs)</h4>
      <p class="lead">
      A set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established to govern the maintenance process and cycle. These SOPs should define how frequently the components should be reviewed or updated, and 
who is responsible for these tasks. For instance, a quarterly update schedule may be adopted for regular enhancements, while critical issues should trigger immediate patching workflows. 
      </p>
      <h4>Feedback and pDNS data provider support system</h4>
      <p class="lead">
       There should be a feedback and pDNS data provider support system implemented to address the queries and technical difficulties. This would help foster trust, encourage continued participation, and ensure smoother 
integration and troubleshooting processes. However, it is important to note that during this process, the identity of 
the pDNS data provider is not exposed at any point. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-heading">Maintaining anonymity with TOR</h3>
      <p class="lead">
       The Privacy shield can be further enhanced by encorporating TOR to maintain anonymity of organizations. BY routing DNS queries through th TOR network, we can ensure that the user's real IP address is hidden and that their online activity remains anonymous. This prevents third parties from tracing the origin of the query. Furthermore, by employing DNS-over-Tor (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocols, you can encrypt DNS traffic and prevent eavesdropping while it traverses the Tor network. This end-to-end encryption and routing through Tor's anonymous network significantly mitigate the risk of identity exposure and traffic analysis, thus enhancing the overall privacy and anonymity of your users
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-heading">Expanding the network</h3>
      <h4 class="section-heading"> Sensor Usability</h4>
      <p class="lead">
      We are now aiming to expand usability by including alternative sensors like IOS and android.This expansion aims to make the Privacy Shield more accessible to a broader range of users and organizations, ensuring that privacy protection is seamless across various platforms. Additionally, we plan to integrate mobile-specific features, including privacy alerts and device-specific optimizations, to further enhance both anonymity and the overall user experience. This will allow us to provide a more robust, versatile, and user-friendly privacy solution, catering to the evolving needs of users across diverse devices.
      </p>
      <h4 class="section-heading">Co-working sensors and shields</h4>
      <p class="lead">We are also aiming on xpanding the Privacy Shield into a distributed and collaborative network consisting of multiple sensors and multiple Privacy Shield instances operating together. Instead of a single centralized deployment, sensors may be deployed across different organizations, networks, and geographical locations, each forwarding anonymized pDNS data to one or more Privacy Shields</p>

</div>
      <p class="lead">In this expanded architecture, multiple Privacy Shields can operate in parallel and exchange selected anonymized threat intelligence, enabling broader visibility into emerging DNS-based threats while avoiding a single point of failure. This federated approach improves scalability, resilience, and fault tolerance, allowing the system to grow as participation increases.</p>
