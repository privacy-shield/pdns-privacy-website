      Sensor
      </h4>
      <p class="lead"> The sensor sits near the DNS resolver and batches up dns queries and sends them over to privacy shield.</p>
      <h4 class="section-heading">
      Privacy Shield
      </h4>
      <p class="lead"> The Privacy Shield ensures that pDNS data is anonymized and secured to protect user privacy. It acts as a filter that prevents personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive internal data from being exposed while still allowing the analysis of DNS queries for security purposes. This shield is essential for ensuring compliance with data privacy laws and maintaining confidentiality while using pDNS data for network monitoring and threat detection.</p>
      <h4 class="section-heading">
      Collector
      </h4>
      <p class="lead"> The pDNS collector is responsible for storing and aggregating the DNS query data captured by sensors. It organizes and stores the data in a centralized database for further analysis. The collector helps maintain historical records of DNS queries, which can be used for forensics, incident response, and identifying long-term patterns or trends in network behavior.</p>
      <h3 class="section-heading">Data processing</h3>

      <p class="lead">
       The sensor sends DNS queries to the shield via UDP packets. This data is then stored in a database. The privacy shield then extracts necessary information to maintain anonymity and is then stored back into the database. The pDNS Collector then retrieves the stored data which is subsequently used for analysis. Throughout the process, a heartbeat mechanism is used to ensure continuos monitoring and synchronisation of the system, allowing real-time data updates.
