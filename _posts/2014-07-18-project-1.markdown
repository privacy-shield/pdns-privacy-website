      <h3 class="section-heading">What Is pDNS?</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        Passive DNS, short for Passive Domain Name System, is a tool commonly used for security and network monitoring purposes. While DNS (Domain Name System) serves as the protocol that translates human-readable domain names (such as www.google.com) into IP addresses for enabling communication between devices over the internet, pDNS goes a step further. Instead of actively querying DNS servers, pDNS passively records DNS query data that has already been made, either by other users, systems, or devices.

      <p class="lead">
       With pDNS, security teams can track the queries made to malicious domains, detect patterns of suspicious behavior, and even investigate incidents after they occur, without compromising the privacy of users. Usually, pDNS does not collect personally identifiable information; instead, it logs only anonymized DNS query data, making it an effective tool for cybersecurity monitoring while respecting user privacy.

      <h3 class="section-heading">Why pDNS privacy matters</h3>
      <p class="lead">
      As cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, modern threat actors often begin with reconnaissance, using techniques like T1590.002 (Gather Victim Network Information – DNS) and T1596.001 (Active Scanning – DNS/Passive DNS) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to leverage DNS data for gathering critical information, affecting individual user browsing privacy and organization security.</p>
      <h4>Individual User browsing Privacy</h4>
      <p class="lead">
      pDNS records when accessed from the database can reveal browsing activities of users, which can be exploited by advertisers, trackers and malicious actors. This prevents users' anonymity and leaks sensitive behavioral information that can lead to phishing and targeted exploitation
      </p>
      <h4>Organizational Security</h4>
      <p class="lead">
      For organization unprotected pDNS data exposes valuable insights about their internal networks, external communication that attackers can use to either exploit business relations or plan intrusions like watering hole attacks
